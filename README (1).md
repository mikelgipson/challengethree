# Password Generator

My goal in this project was to make a password generator that will be able to fully function when given specific criteria. I wanted the code to be efficient and clear of all errors for the visitors. I wanted the flow of the code to connect to each line from top to bottom without confusing the visitors as well as myself. This helped me become more aware of what I was exactly doing at the moment. 

Working on this assignment has helped me become more familiar with "if" and "else" statements. I struggled in the beginning by not being able to use them at the correct time. Also, using functions was the main reason why I was able to get this website to work. Adding functions to my code definitely simplified my coding tremendously. I struggled to add additional coding to my javascript. I wanted to be able to prompt an error message when the user declines the use of criteria, but I was unable to add that portion. Although I struggled with that part, I am very happy with the results of this website.
